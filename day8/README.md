# Day 8 - Learnings

* Dove more deeply into how to propagate errors from functional-style "map" lambdas.  See https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/iter_result.html#fail-the-entire-operation-with-collect
* "Trees on the edge are always visible" that's the easy part
* "Trees must have shorter trees in every direction all the way to the edge" - that takes a bit more work.   I'm going to have to think about a good way to do that.
